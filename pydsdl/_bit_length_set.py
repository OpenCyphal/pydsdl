    This type represents the Bit Length Set as defined in the Specification.

    Instances are comparable between each other, with plain integers, and with native sets of integers.
    The methods do not mutate the instance they are invoked on; instead, the result is returned as a new instance,

    This class performs very intensive computations that largely define the data type processing time

        """
        This operation is fundamental for bit length and bit offset (which are, generally, the same thing) computation.

        The basic background is explained in the specification. The idea is that the bit offset of a given entity
        in a data type definition of the structure category (or, in other words, the bit length set of serialized
        representations of the preceding entities, which is the same thing, assuming that the data type is of the
        structure category) is a function of bit length sets of each preceding entity. Various combinations of
        bit lengths of the preceding entities are possible, which can be expressed through the Cartesian product over
        the bit length sets of the preceding entities. Since in a type of the structure category entities are arranged
        as an ordered sequence of a fixed length (meaning that entities can't be added or removed), the resulting
        bit length (offset) is computed by elementwise summation of each element of the Cartesian product.

        This method is not applicable for the tagged union type category, since a tagged union holds exactly one
        value at any moment; therefore, the bit length set of a tagged union is simply a union of bit length sets
        of each entity that can be contained in the union, plus the length of the implicit union tag field.

        From the standpoint of bit length combination analysis, fixed-length arrays are a special case of structures,
        because they also contain a fixed ordered sequence of fields, where all fields are of the same type.
        The method defined for structures applies to fixed-length arrays, but one should be aware that it may be
        computationally suboptimal, since the fact that all array elements are of the same type allows us to replace
        the computationally expensive Cartesian product with k-multicombinations (k-selections).

        In the context of bit length analysis, variable-length arrays do not require any special treatment, since a
        variable-length array with the capacity of N elements can be modeled as a tagged union containing
        N fixed arrays of length from 1 to N, plus one empty field (representing the case of an empty variable-length
        array).
