# Our unorthodox approach to dependency management requires us to apply certain workarounds.
# Here, the objective is to allow our library to import stuff from its third-party dependency directory,
# but at the same time we don't want to interfere with the application that depends on this library.
# So we modify the import lookup path temporarily while the package initialization is in progress;
# when done, we restore the path back to its original value. One implication is that it won't be possible
# to import stuff dynamically after the initialization is finished (e.g., function-local imports won't be
# able to reach the third-party stuff), but we don't care.
