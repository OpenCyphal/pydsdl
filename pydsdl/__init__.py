# The original intent was to support Python 3.5 and newer; however, we have discovered a bug in the static typing
# library in Python 3.5.2 which makes the library quite unusable: when importing, the typing module would throw
# "TypeError: This Callable type is already parameterized." from the expression module. The problem does not appear
# in Python 3.5.3 or any newer versions; it is fixed in the upstream here: https://github.com/python/typing/pull/308.
# This is how you can reproduce it in REPL; first, the correct behavior that can be observed in Python 3.5.3+:
#   >>> import typing
#   >>> T = typing.TypeVar('T')
#   >>> G = typing.Callable[[], T]
#   >>> G[int]
#   typing.Callable[[], int]
# And this is what you get in Python 3.5.2-:
#   >>> import typing
#   >>> T = typing.TypeVar('T')
#   >>> G = typing.Callable[[], T]
#   >>> G[int]
#   Traceback (most recent call last):
#     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
#     File "/usr/lib/python3.5/typing.py", line 815, in __getitem__
#       raise TypeError("This Callable type is already parameterized.")
#   TypeError: This Callable type is already parameterized.

# Our unorthodox approach to dependency management requires us to apply certain workarounds.
# Here, the objective is to allow our library to import stuff from its third-party dependency directory,
# but at the same time we don't want to interfere with the application that depends on this library.
# So we modify the import lookup path temporarily while the package initialization is in progress;
# when done, we restore the path back to its original value. One implication is that it won't be possible
# to import stuff dynamically after the initialization is finished (e.g., function-local imports won't be
# able to reach the third-party stuff), but we don't care.
