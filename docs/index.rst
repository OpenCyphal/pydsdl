PyDSDL documentation
====================

PyDSDL is a UAVCAN DSDL compiler front-end implemented in Python.
It accepts a DSDL namespace at the input and produces a well-annotated abstract syntax tree (AST) at the output,
evaluating all constant expressions in the process.
All DSDL features defined in the UAVCAN Specification are supported.

It helps to know that `UAVCAN <https://uavcan.org>`_ stands for
*Uncomplicated Application-level Vehicular Computing And Networking*.

If you have questions, please bring them to the `support forum <https://forum.uavcan.org/>`_.
