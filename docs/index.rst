PyDSDL documentation
====================

PyDSDL is a `Cyphal <https://opencyphal.org>`_ DSDL compiler front-end implemented in Python.
It accepts a DSDL namespace at the input and produces a well-annotated abstract syntax tree (AST) at the output,
evaluating all constant expressions in the process.
All DSDL features defined in the Cyphal Specification are supported.

If you have questions, please bring them to the `support forum <https://forum.opencyphal.org/>`_.
