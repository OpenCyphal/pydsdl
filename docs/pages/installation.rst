Installation
============

PyDSDL is compatible with and is tested against all current versions of Python.
It should, in theory, work on any platform and with any Python implementation.
There are no third-party dependencies.

PyDSDL can be installed from PyPI::

    pip install pydsdl

Alternatively, embed this repository into your codebase,
add its root to the Python import lookup paths, and you're ready to roll.
